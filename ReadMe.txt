Fox Rabbit Cabbage ridde.
Objective: You must get all three on the other side of the river safely
You may only carry one object in your boat with you at any given point.
If you leave the fox alone with the rabbit he will it him, same goes for the rabbit with the cabbage.
There is a timer, and all animals and cabbage must make it accross in under one minute, or else the game will stop any input from the user

Bugs: There are a few bugs, sometimes the Lose text will be overwritten by the boat
