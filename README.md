# Fox-Rabbit-Cabbage

This is a super simple yet fun riddle. 

I made this when I was first learning CSS/JS/HTML and therefore it is a bit archaic and ugly.
Still thought I would upload it to github so I can look back on it years later when I'm further in the industry


Rules:
You must move the rabbit, cabbage and fox to the other side of the river with your boat. Your boat can only transfer 1 of these 3 at a time.
If you leave the rabbit with the cabbage on either side alone the rabbit will eat the cabbage and you will lose.
If you leave the fox with the rabbit on either side alone the fox will eat the rabbit and you will lose.

Find a way to transfer both the fox, rabbit and cabbage safely to the other side one at a time.
